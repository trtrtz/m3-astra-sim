### Main File ###
1. The main file of ns3 is **AstraSimNetwork.cc**. This file containt the ASTRA-SIM network API implementation. It also defines worklaods and system input files.
2. The network input file is fed in `build/astra_ns3/build.sh` file with the envvar **NETWORK**. The current input is 'mix/config.txt' (https://github.com/astra-sim/astra-network-ns3/blob/main/simulation/mix/config.txt). Inside the 'mix/config.txt', there is a parameter called **TOPOLOGY_FILE** which takes the topology file that describes the physical topology (link connection, switch, nodes, etc). The actual file is located within the ns3 submodule due to licensing issues. 
3. The logical topology file, fed in `build.sh` under the envvar **LOGICAL_TOPOLOGY**, describes how many of these NPUs we are actually going to use, in what logical topology. This file is the source for the vector `physical_dims``. If this value is {64}, this allocates the first 64 NPUs to the workload. If this value is {8,8}, it will allocate the same number of NPUs, but the topology will be 2D. (Think of a scenario where we have a physical cluster of 128 nodes, but use only 64 of them. The physical topology defined in **TOPOLOGY_FILE** will have 128 nodes, but the logical topology defined in **LOGICAL_TOPOLOGY** will only indicate 64 nodes.)
4. The system input file should match the dimension as defined in `physical_dims`. Currently there is no checker to ensure correctness.
